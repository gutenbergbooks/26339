Not Mere Fortune Telling.

[<i>From Sun-Flower</i>.]<br>
<br>
PROPHECY.</center>


<p>"Prophecy is the science of being able to
sense the casual influences or vibrations governing the person or subject on which the
consciousness is centered, and knowing the
purport or meaning of these influences. To
the non-sensitive this has no existence, and he
must judge the future by surface effects entirely--his knowledge of human character or of the
subject to which he is devoted. A feeling of
peace or quietude; that which disturbs or irritates; animates or enervates; engenders joy or
gloom; that which attracts or repels without
visible effects, are some of the sensations experienced and have their specific meanings, which
must be grouped, counter-effects considered,
and conclusions drawn from this to make the forecast or outline of the subject's future. To
avert mistakes, however, the reader of destinies
must have sufficient self-knowledge to distinguish his own influences or vibrations from those
sensed in others and not combine them as
coming from one source. Every individual is
governed by this 'cause upon him,' and if
he studies himself he can become his own
prophet."</p>

<center>THE FOUR-LEAF CLOVER.<br>
	<br>
ELLA HIGGINSON.</center>

<blockquote><p>I know a place where the sun is like gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the cherry blooms burst with snow,<br>
And down underneath is the loveliest nook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the four-leaf clovers grow.</p>

<p>One leaf is for hope, and one is faith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one is for love, you know;<br>
And God put another one in for luck--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you search you will find where they grow.</p>

<p>But you must have hope and you must have faith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must love and be strong, and so,<br>
If you work, if you wait, you will find the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the four-leaf clovers grow.</p></blockquote>

<center>THE GRACE WE SAY TO GOD.<br>
	<br>
[JEAN INGELOW.]</center>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So take joy home,<br>
And make a place in thy great heart for her,<br>
And give her time to grow and cherish her;<br>
Then will she come and oft will sing to thee<br>
When thou art working in the furrows; ay,<br>
Or weeding in the sacred hour of dawn.<br>
It is a comely fashion to be glad--<br>
Joy is the grace we say to God.</p></blockquote>

<center>LOVE'S SECRETS READ.</center>

<p>These revelations are honestly dedicated to
bright folks, who study human needs, and to
such as possess and inspire a bit of high-soul,
creative imagination, as well as to humanitarians, who become capable of knowing, advising and showing the better sides of life by
lofty mental concentration, which ever lifts
the thinker into the special soul atmosphere
of each separate mentality, by the power of
attraction and repulsion, verily, by the cosmic law of life, gaining thereby deeper insight
into what seemeth best to think and to do for
self and for others.</p>

<p>Believing that these, my life-long experiences, will prove both instructive
and highly entertaining, I am happy to send forth these <i>talismanic</i> best thoughts, which may indeed
become noble and satisfying possessions to
many active and wisely applying minds, for
the healthful enjoyment of their friends
and associates.</p>

<center>CHAPTER I.</center>
<br>
<center>HELPFUL HINTS FOR FRIENDLY SOCIAL GATHERINGS.</center>


<p>First cup turned was by a tall, handsome
girl, who, herself, possesses keen imagination
with true power for character-reading, and with
love for the study of the occult sciences.</p>

<p>In her very first turn, the sky with misty scenes and an <i>airship</i> were traced well up
in the lines surrounding the lady.</p>

<p>High, sailing hopes, said the reader. You
are gifted beyond the ordinary. You love
books, study and art; do not yet care for any
domestic duties. You are in cloud-lands.</p>

<p>In her second toss, the reading was as follows:</p>

<p>You are a little more practical. Here is formed a dusting-brush, also a <i>kitchen</i>
and yard with a happy family of <i>chickens</i>, meaning cares and pets; also a <i>horse</i>
and <i>sleigh</i>. You love luxuries. You have traveled over land and seas. The <i>ferry-boat</i> is here.</p>

<p>I read now in your third, the certainty, though not fully, noting some of the
minor events. Everything has changed from your present thinking. You have
climbed the ladder to some public recognition by the influence of friends. You
have yet much to achieve--will become a real benefactress. So I read by the
people before you. The two <i>stars</i> yet beyond, and the <i>sword</i> which belongs to your
family, represent some hero in wars yet to be.</p>

<p>The national bird, either an <i>eagle</i> or <i>turkey</i>, promises good results.</p>

<p>The trials of others will fall upon you, all through life. Your views here
are full of the different objects. A tall visitor will give you a surprise,
attended by coming pleasure, and a new friend; also a <i>foe</i>--a <i>spider</i>.
You have been disappointed in three different forms, one is yet to entail a
financial loss<i>--fish</i>, you see, have their heads and tails cut off; and
the <i>rings</i> are broken for some past and present enterprise. You are learning mental philosophy,
also, from a male relative to whom you are
very dear.</p>

<p>How truly and wonderfully you have read!
I have also gained an idea how to trace and to
hold the mind in other special desires. Thanks
to you for this lesson.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>The next was a dainty, little, self-conscious lady, who is desirous of some
special, social accomplishment, aside from her sisters. She is very cunning. See
the little head of the <i>fox</i> near her, though vexations are with her now,
yet the three similar little straight forms, or lines, are realizations, as in
this cup, of some pleasant event. The <i>road</i> here in view, a short and
agreeable journey, upon which you meet a lady friend who is to visit you soon.
These upper <i>dots</i> are letters and small packages near at hand, with two
little <i>hearts</i>--love secrets.</p>

<p>You will, said the reader, receive many. One, that is in present expectation,
containing an invitation affording pleasure. The <i>flowers</i> bespeak it,
being near the edge of the cup, with the formation of letters. H
will be the initial of one of the writers. Now, you have a <i>little man</i> who
is to be cut off from some desire--a broken <i>road</i> is near him--with a period of
indecision and anxiety. Two male forms are
holding his desires by their neglect, not by
malice. The wish is in their power, you see,
yet they are looking away from it.</p>

<p>Your third is with tears for a friend, though no death symbol is near. Ah,
here it is! You are to wed with a fair gentleman, not your slight form--first
love. You will be fairly happy. Confusion is shown by the various objects in
crooked and wavy lines, with those tiny <i>crosses</i>, many little cares, and
yet the <i>tree</i> shades the <i>house</i>. Your <i>castle</i> on the highway with the little
child's <i>crib</i> and the <i>parrot</i>, an
imitative, impudent inmate of the home.</p>

<p>Now, let your own fancy roam over these formations. Set them in your mind. I
have reserved this gift of love for the last sitting. Do you see the <i>jeweled ring</i>
with the light flashing for you? That will come when years have flown. You will
be a widow. That event will benefit your entire family, as the <i>wavy
lines</i> and <i>tears</i> indicate, so do not lose heart.
This late blessing is enough to inspire courage
and patience. Yes, it is for your household.
Do you see the broad sky-scenes? That is good.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>Next: <i>A hay-mound</i> and a <i>field</i>. You love
rural life, young man.</p>

<p>I do, said he, as a retreat and recreation. This <i>square</i> promises you a business house
in a commercial city. See the stacks of letters
and the figures 3, 7, 10,--and the many heads
of men in calculation.</p>

<p>Now you stand by an open grave. Your dearest friend has died. The dark cloak
enfolds your form and your wish--<i>the circle</i>--is in doubt. <i>Spears</i>
and <i>weeds</i> are near it, also a crude <i>cross</i>. A time of dissatisfaction will
come to you before three years have passed,
yet there are promises beyond. Cast, now,
for the better times for certainty.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>Third: <i>Friends, horses, dogs, birds, trees</i>.</p>

<p>In touch with life's blessings you possess a kind, social nature--a <i>stream</i> of clear
water. Health and friends in plenty, great
activity. You are to rise above many ills.</p>

<p>A broken <i>bridge</i> is at the far end of this <i>road</i>, but your face is
turned away, in this you are spared an evil, be wise. The South will offer you
last and final protection. See, the light is shading in that direction. An <i>old lady
</i>will be your faithful friend. There will be also a trusty <i>colored man</i>--see
how he stands in <i>line?</i> Your last years will be in rural life,
with a family and an income with fair surroundings. The space is clear. You see light
is over your last scenes. See the young girl--no doubt your daughter--under the beautiful
fruit trees?</p>

<p>Orange groves in the sunny South, said he, smiling.</p>

<p>Most important for yon appears a distant battle-scene with deep sorrows. Some
great personal honors in life for a son. Yes, an American battle scene with the <i>eagle</i> distant,
yet sure to gain the day.</p>

<br>

<center>SOME NATIONAL CRISIS.<br>
<br>
NEXT READING.</center>

<p><i>Key</i> to the situation. See, it is within a
short time, only a little way from the edge of
the cup.</p>

<p>Good, said the recipient, I know what that
is now, am glad of it.</p>


<p>Well, you are, however, to weep over the matter soon, as speaking to some
friend of this affair. There is much to it. See the <i>cross</i> and <i>tears</i>,
as holding up the cup. Yet you would not now dream that there are complications
in this affair. Three factions, yet all in positive expectations, though fight
is coming. See the little <i>dog</i>, how angry, and the <i>cat</i>, with her back up, and the other animal with a spring?
Why here. Can't you see it! Of course it's not
quite as distinct as a real dog and cat fight.
One of the animals is retreating from the
scene in fear. Your faces are all turned in the
same direction, you know each other.</p>

<p>Well, the <i>crescent</i> is in the lower part of the cup. Some later
news--also the fine <i>horse</i>, a <i>friend</i> with some testimonial of
appreciation. A <i>wreath</i> and victory. Here are several <i>letters,
</i>one containing news of death. The <i>coffin</i> is
here for the little child. Many tears are shed
by two women--each looks into the grave.</p>

<p>Ah, the spite lines! See them, there are
little jealousies, too. We all have these to
content with, said the reader, especially if we
ever rise above the common level of life and as
independent thinkers.</p>

<p>An illness of importance is now developing an event long ago foretold to your
family. A fine steed comes from another city through a church-yard, much
resembling Trinity E of New York City. Some <i>letters</i> follow--see the
succession of <i>dots</i> and <i>squares. Houses</i> of <i>smoke, news</i> and <i>trailing objects</i>, representing
deep-laid intrigues.</p>

<p>Now you are aboard a steamer on the broad ocean. A tall, military looking man
is with you, also a young man and woman. Something of importance has taken place
in your national life and in your financial position, as well as in political
and church affairs. See the crowing <i>cock</i> and the <i>stork</i>, a change
that is to play its part for the tall man. <i>Flags</i> are waving.
You will all return to a new life in America.
The surprising change is for a public man.</p>

<br>

<center>NEXT READING.</center>

<p>An enemy is for you, sir, in your present conditions of duty. Some spoil is
here. A <i>ditch</i>, a <i>wasp</i>, and <i>serpents</i> at the top with tongues
out. If you are now in politics or litigation defeats await you, for the <i>briars</i> are
thick and a blind man at a desk holds some
document. You appear to be very expectant,
though fearing something. A woman is also
against you. See, her head is up. She is fair
in appearance and influential, yet false. Some
men are back of her acts.</p>

<p>Dark complexioned people are, at present, your better allies and friends.
Some doctor stands by your side, see his medicine chest, he is of fine mind. A
straight path lies between you, though some road is cut in two; you are to be
disappointed in an enterprise. <i>Wheels
</i>are broken. This is connected with cars,
engines and automobiles--have care.</p>

<p>Your mind is often too ready to speed forward. Things are so confusing.</p>

<p>Now concentrate on the future. You are enmeshed by others. Your social
affairs, too, are meddled with by your family and pseudo friends. See the
quacking <i>duck</i> and the distant <i>goose</i>, with dots, letters, etc. See the
heads put together, with mixture of objects
before them. No symbol of peace is in this
realm, no light nor clean spots are as yet seen
as results to you.</p>

<p>Ah! here. It is a <i>long road</i> into new conditions. Anger and loss cause
you to turn away from the dark and vexing things. One true friend will follow.
See the <i>straight form</i> and the <i>dog</i> and <i>wheat</i>--that signifies great good as in clean sheaves.
That will be your best destiny in a new life-deal--far westward--some treasure
in minerals, too. See the rocks shining forth.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>Next: The <i>monkey</i> and the <i>skunk</i>! For a
moment the hostess and the reader exchanged words. "I wonder if there is such an object
now in our midst! I am full of laugh, though
not in the belief of such a fact. Oh, it is too
amusing how these objects will form. I wish
some one else to see this strange cup."</p>

<p>This gentleman has need to be most cautious in some of his undertakings. Do
not deal with uncertain characters--see the <i>monkey</i> and the <i>cat-tiger</i>
or <i>skunk</i> looking object--lest some vile scandal becomes your lot. <i>Cross-roads,
hollows</i>, and <i>eels</i>--slippery things--are near your <i>present wishes</i>.
The <i>keys, circles, anchor,
squares, links</i>--these represent realizations. Yours are in other lines, yet
a <i>bell</i> is traced near you. A belated wish lies under cover. It is in a
field not yet in your thoughts, though an <i>anchor</i>, a human form and a crooked,
broken path lie yet beyond that.</p>

<br>

<center>THIRD TOSS.</center>

<p>Now is revealed some disaster to friends, confusion and a large family <i>whirlwind</i>,
also, some obstinate man--see the <i>rickety team</i> with the <i>mule</i> in
the lead, as running away--a woman in black as the outcome. See how she climbs
the steep, jagged hill. Your face is turning towards her in mutual friendship.
The <i>moon</i> shines on the top of the mountain--your destination. You will no doubt wed with
the widow--this woman in black.</p>

<p>Some of the first lines hit very close to facts, said he.</p>

<p>I know it, said the lady, and there is very much to read. I do not know all
that may transpire before this occurs, yet you will have a numerous
progeny--many relatives. See the people and the letters from the different
localities, again true. You will live to advanced age--see the grand <i>old tree</i>. You will ever have
care over others. The man-mule is to meet
his natural death. His respected widow and household are to become your high
possessions.</p>

<p>The mules and the whole team? said he.
Thank you, there is happiness in store.</p><p></p>
<p>No doubt as elevated step-father to this
numerous family. You are a genius in this art
reading, so fanciful.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>Next expectant:--A Civil Engineer with fondness for travel and <i>inventions</i>.
Perhaps you will also write books on some new methods in heating houses--an <i>oven</i>
and <i>tubes</i> are in formation; so also a tall man at his desk with pencils.
I do like to get something worth reading, but here is a break-down, something
really thrilling--the mountain topples over on the road. You are soon to be, or
have been, in great peril. I also see a <i>fireman</i>. Do you see
his hat?</p>

<p>The man smiled, yet confessed, as I read on.</p>

<p>You carry an atmosphere that aids the reading. You have had an escape by not being at
the "Windsor" that special afternoon.</p>

<p>He was surprised. "She is a fine guesser,"
said the young man, highly pleased.</p>

<p>Again, you cherish a happy hope in an elderly couple. They are your true
friends. You are now all in the same lines of thought. Oh, there is a modest,
young lady coming to the elderly folks. She is now away in some large
building--a school, I think. You will <i>love her</i>. She has a lover who writes to her--you do not--yet the signs are to be favorable
to both of you. Now for the last toss.</p>

<p>I am disappointed in your efforts. Oh, how
it storms! See the snow-flakes and the great
stream of water! I really feel its cold currents
now. Something is to be destroyed by it ere
you meet the lady. She is in the bottom of the cup. Why have you left her so long. I
can hardly find her. You will need to strive
for your good fate.</p>

<p>She is to pass out of your life I think some years before you do, yet you
will live an active life. Many artistic <i>new roads</i> and the <i>plough.
</i>You will create something truly beautiful--see the <i>pedestal</i> amid the
landscape--the <i>swing
</i>and <i>gardening</i>. How <i>restful</i> it makes me feel!
You will be so, sometime, young man.</p>

<br>

<center>OBJECT LESSONS.</center>

<p>Now, young ladies, concentrate your minds
and let us note the symbols, if your wish really
to have views and comprehensive enjoyment,
so that what is shown in each cup may be at
the close interestingly connected. Like in a
Primer, let us go straight through. You have
heard other readings, develop your descriptive
faculties. Do not stop till done to discuss in
detail, thereby losing the best effects, and you
will thus find some interesting results. You
see how most persons like to lift the veil to
revelations. Much progress lies before us all.</p>

<br>

<center>SURPRISED.</center>

<p>Just look here, Florence, said the amateur, <i>rings</i> and a <i>sunrise</i>,
not out of the clouds either. Look, too, at the oval forms like <i>eggs.
</i>At home we can't get such cups. Here we are
in the higher waves. We are determined to
read something to inspire others, as you read
to us, said the girls with eagerness.</p>

<p>But, which one of you ladies turned the cup? I ought to have directed my occult forces on
one at a time. Now, you need to divide honors
and loss.</p>

<p>The one who is herein represented is in a most happy frame of mind. I wish it
were the test cup--the third and certainty--for the sake of the fortunate lady
and her family, then your destiny were assured and your mentality would advance
into lofty channels by the influence of an elderly couple and their progressive <i>sons</i>,
for here is a <i>tower</i> of moral strength. <i>Hearts, circles, Bible</i> and <i>clovers</i> are in the
life-path. The skies, too, are clear and every
thing is high up you see in optimism.</p>

<p>Let us now to business. Ah! here it is--gains. A large <i>goose egg</i> is in
shape, also a <i>nest</i>. That is the home, though a great care has fallen into
it. See the rain and these many little crosses here together so near the <i>nest</i>, which, in this turn, is the home, as there
is no other symbol for it; now you can trace
the square as the home-hearts also.</p>

<p>You are kind and come from sympathetic people who love truth, books and
progress, as does this Bible family. An old man who is in another city will
write. See the <i>M.</i>, the <i>letters
</i>and the <i>road</i>. There being no form of a man you take the initial. He
may be <i>sixty-one
</i>years of age; see, the numbers are touching the <i>M</i>.--man--in the midst
of the dots. <i>Sticks
</i>and <i>crossties</i> with <i>wavy lines--</i>common vexations.</p>

<p>Do not worry. Though you are now apprised of a large theft which may come
into your home. See the sly <i>rat</i>--a thief or burglar
hovers nigh, have care. You have a few events
in Jupiter still left.</p>

<p>How is it to be read?</p>

<p>Each reader must speak as the momentary inspirations come to suit occasions:
We must promise the best, to stimulate <i>all</i> good efforts,
not only for self.</p>

<p>Well, you are really good and correct. I
feel elevated by this interesting reading.</p>

<p>We are delighted and shall share together
this life-reading. Our families are very dear
to each other and may be still further united.
Then she blushed slightly, as whispering confidentially.</p>

<p>Oh, it's lovely, said the two girls, as others
said the fates had favored them most of all.</p>

<center>* * *</center>

<p>Several of the readings were too ordinary,
just as many people are in truth, who contribute nothing for the benefit of higher thought
and action, while others were not in good
mental states nor in their lucky days, as they
said, and as is partly true.</p>

<p>One young man, a news-gatherer, could get
nothing as all things lay distant and for others.
"My life is to be forever blocked," said he
though feigning total scepticism, yet a tone of
disappointment was quite apparent when told that six months hence he should have
a comprehensive word with new hopes.</p>

<p>You are in the wrong world, and somehow I
felt that he would be fairly driven into his real
vocation by a lucky circumstance, for Mother
Nature is ever kind to her children, though
needing all honest co-operation. Those keen
eyes with fine perceptives and vivacious mentality would direct his impulses eventually,
for the power of reason and resource lay within
his then, somewhat undecided, brain, so have
faith in your higher destiny, friends.</p>

<center>CHAPTER II.
<br>
<br>
ONE YEAR LATER.</center>


<p>Being patient and obliging, said a young
lady, has cheated me out of my rights so many
times. I was to have a reading that night at
the home of Mrs. M. C. for I served with hopes
and glad expectations into each dainty cup of
aromatic coffee that I poured, yet, as usual, did
not get my reading. Never have. I had either
palm reading, cup or solar biology forecast,
though promised each. Oh, I was so disappointed, for it was my desire to learn your
special, catchy methods, and to note the sensations cast upon me as under the magic spell.
I cannot formulate the things you do, though
my friends praise me unstintingly.</p>

<p>You shall not be longer denied, said the
adept. Get a cup of coffee or tea, if not too
coarse in leaves, after we lunch. I will read
them, as we can be alone with our atmospheric
thought advisers and our higher selves. I
know that your life and labors will abound in good. Many excellent things await your
efforts, yet do not now think that my auto
thoughts will be my full guides.</p>

<p>Oh, thank you. How nice the conditions are
to be alone with one's future expectations.
No one can then pervert what is promised. I
am now most expectant, am glad I have
waited for this propitious time. I love this
little room with its dainty furnishings.</p>

<br>

<center>FIRST READING.</center>

<p>You possess fine spiritual gifts; are morally high-toned; you build many
castles--just see the <i>mountains</i> and <i>balloons</i>, the <i>tower</i> in the
distance. You could study palmistry and
occult laws to fine advantage. It has become
so respectable, too, you know. Yet few do
excel, though many attempts are made. Try it, you are very susceptible to every
personality; you have a very retentive memory with
large formative powers. Just the requisites
with your mentality for doing good to poor
humanity. As a wise teacher you could excel.</p>

<br>

<center>SECOND CUP.</center>

<p>Flurries of wind and storms--confusion in your home and heart--<i>crooked lines</i>
with a <i>crude cross</i> and a <i>sodden log</i>, out of which will rise a <i>broken anchor</i>--lost
hopes or wishes. Now, an ugly thing is discerned. See the <i>spitting</i> of <i>cats</i>
and the <i>angry dog</i>. That is some disagreeable quarrel between friends of
yours. A gentleman will pass through cruel loss and change. Nothing good is yet
promised to present wishes. <i>Serpents</i> are lying low in the grass--see
their heads, you will suffer thereby--your head now lays low in some severe
illness. Fate is silent and sad for a time, as in mourning for the sorrows of
the good and true. See you the <i>shaft</i>, draped like a funeral pall
across the cup? You are also to bury a friend,
a worthy minister. The people mourn. Now
let us invoke the kindly powers to a solution
of the many evils cast by contending conditions of jealousies and spite. Let your soul be
possessed and purified, for now I know that
you are truly one of the chosen few who are
tried by the fierce fires and floods of life. This
is a retrospective day for your soul--growth
beyond your realization of [sentence is unfinished].</p>

<br>

<center>FINAL INFLOW.</center>

<p>A seriousness had fallen over both of them as touching on the live issues of frail, human
hopes and fears, so that each felt the need of
that great unseen, yet ever-living power divine.
What a strange cup-reading it was in the end!
Wonderful to both of them, yet they somehow
tarried, as though fearing to reveal the certainty chapters, as you now know the third is
designated, yet the soul was sated.</p>

<p>Wealth, in some physical form, I find is the
great desire, more even than love or friendship,
so that I repeat the golden words of the poet,
though knowing the need of money for worthy
purposes. There will be for us just enough of
the pure coin, not this "God of greed."</p>

<br>

<p><blockquote><center>THE GOLDEN GOD.<br>
<br>
[THOMAS HOOD.]</center>

<p>Gold! gold! gold! gold!<br>
Bright and yellow, hard and cold;<br>
Molten, graven, hammered and rolled;<br>
Heavy to get and light to hold;<br>
Hoarded, bartered, bought and sold,<br>
Stolen, borrowed, squandered, doled;<br>
Spurned by the young, but hugged by the old<br>
To the very verge of church-yard mould,<br>
Price of many a crime untold;<br>
Gold! gold! gold! gold!</blockquote>

<br>

<p>Then said the psychometrist: Now, look
with me into this cup. Let us, together, trace
the final symbols, now that we are united as
true friends.</p>

<p>The form of a woman--see her head and her garments blown forward, the wind is
at her back. She goes now with some strong, public tide. That is well. In this
clear field there is recognition for you. An <i>electric street light</i>--that, too, is some public good in process for
your sharing;--and here is like a flowing stream.
The mountains are, also, again in view. Each
effort holds in a life-reading like this. Some
rubbish before reaching the heights.</p>

<p>But look! Oh, behold the <i>moon</i> behind the hills. See, it is surely
beginning to rise. Let your mind now concentrate on its sublime glory. It is the
best kind of promise. Honors await yourself and another member of your family. A
full moon signifies that other events have poured their treasures into
conditions which have required time. Your moon is not yet over the full scenes
of your life. The sunrise, too, appears! How sublime! Here is the stout
man--your future husband with a child at his side. A man of affairs, with the <i>triangle</i>
and a <i>ship</i> of <i>state</i>, and here are the roses growing. You will be
greatly beloved. The <i>key</i> and the <i>ring</i> are in the bottom of the
cup. You will become equal to your high social duties as mistress of the <i>castle</i>, and
mother of two well endowed children, who
will bless and survive you. The latter years of
your life will be the most richly frought. See,
the bottom of the third cup, also, has the clear
streams.</p>

<p>I shall expect you to wed with this stout,
dark complexioned man, whose wife lies in the
little grave that was in the second toss of the
cup. We can now join the parts fittingly
together, by noting first, second and this final.
We may now attach other straying symbols as
holding them in mind.</p>

<p>Thank you, ah, so much. I have gained real knowledge from this very
interesting object-lesson reading, which stimulates my higher mental action with
courage and purpose. Some things delineated I now believe as true. The first <i>cups</i> were a veritable marvel, yet too
sadly comprehensive. I am greatly indebted
to you for this most infatuating pleasure, proving the old adage, that the last
do sometimes come first, by their patience. We all
need just such talks sometimes. These are beyond the mere realms of pastime, said the
reader, who was then inspired of God.</p>

<br>

<center>HALLOWEEN REVELATIONS.<br>
<br>
THE ENERGETIC MAN OF HIGH PURPOSE
POLITICALLY.</center>

<p>Here is an important cup. A long bridge.
You are now in comprehensive touch with a
subject-matter that ought to lead you with
your family into ease and prominence. Have patient care after you have reached
the seeming goal, for, see here still the danger signal
from the broken cart of past obstruction with
the cross-ties. Do not retreat in dismay. A
bridge is of good significance unless you fall
between, or it is broken while you are facing it
or are thereon. You must be strong. In your
trials, being magnetic, your forces will bring
help to aid you by mental suggestions.</p>

<p>But see this elephant, tossing about at the
end of the bridge--some imposition upon your
family. See, the house being in touch, you
will lose by the elephant, as letters with many lines mean vexation--strayed or
stolen letters--and dead birds are on the ground. The rabbit
is some coward. Do not mind this, you will
yet gain significant prestige by the aid of an old man on the new path. See him
nearing the <i>trees</i> in luxurious foliage--a true friend.</p>

<p>Now we sum up gains. You have striven.
See the three rings or wreaths, the sunburst,
and the distant tower clearly defined in the
light. Victory over loss and cowardice of
friends. You are happy and secure.</p>

<p>The summing up represents the home several
years hence. Many scattered objects have
cleared away the defeats belonging to your life,
in order to round it out symmetrically. There
is good cheer. Think of the toiling masses as
becomes a true disciple of the Christ. You
will be in position to manifest to the world
some vital principle. Be not then enslaved by
time-serving, selfish man. Stand by the flag of
your nation in honest and worth. Your star
shines high.</p>

<br>

<center>WOMAN OUT OF THE SHADOWS.<br>
<br>
FACTS FORETOLD.</center>

<p>Many streams--mental changes. Though here is a great symbol,
that of the ancients--the serpent--being wisdom. This one is of
different significance. See how its long body
has taken up space. The tail is three-forked
and downward, the head being turned around, sharpened like a shepherd's crook, lower than
the body. Deception--intrigue--house of sickness--see the crosses and losses? The one
tossing such a cup has been assailed in various
ways. Look now well to the above outlines
which still hold a splendid promise. Arches
overhead--cannot be vanquished.</p>

<br>

<center>SYMBOLS FOR A JUDGESHIP.<br>
<br>
FATEFUL SPITE-LINES WITH WOMAN.</center>

<p>Appearances do oft deceive, good reader,
though the cup figures hit my case correctly,
beyond words of mine, as to past and some present events. May the future be as well
verified, and I somehow believe it will be.
You say the flame is now on after twenty-two
long years of defeat; I also cross the water
often, as you read, am soon to locate in a large
eastern city. May this flame you describe
possess my mind and heart as now.</p>

<p>And your conscience, sir, the Holy Spirit
within the higher self. Your symbols urge you
to noble deeds, yet you will never be blessed by woman's love, nor aid. Do you
see the standing well-poised form of a woman? Rising
power--creative force. See she has her feet
firm on the back of the monster snake. You will soon become master of your
higher destiny. I feel inspired by a mighty impulse.
You will stand before many people--see the
tall, straight ladder of fame--I should say that
you are holding some still-cherished, mighty
plans, despite many of life's defeats.</p>

<p>Now, as this is all free play, will you please
tell me if this leading figure defines any of
your conditions truthfully, as to politics? You
deeply impress me with the ideas of large
affairs.</p>

<p>Will see you later, madam.</p>

<p>Thank you cordially.</p>

<center>CHAPTER III.
<br>
<br>
THE WOMAN'S ERA OF NATIONAL IMPORT.<br>
<br>
AN UNUSUAL KALEIDOSCOPE----HUSBAND AND WIFE.</center>

<p>As the symbols are in uniting conjunction,
you may both remain to formulate ideas and
to delineate. You are no doubt desirous of
the full enfranchisement of the human race.
You seem just and liberal, as read by these
various lights, amid contentions, yet with one
central apex--the lighted lamp.</p>

<br>

<center>NEXT TOSS.</center>

<p>No taxation, without due representation.
Now, look into this remarkable cup, with our
Uncle Sam large as American life, one foot
raised in forward move, as firmly holding the
grand flag of the nation. See, upon it sails in
earnestness a tall woman of high modern
import. See you these faces? They are no
milk and water characters. They come close together, Uncle Sam and the woman, as though
to embrace in true love and lasting equality.
Now, behold the bird ascending the mountain,
and the large hen and cockrell. Behold the
dove still higher up. Justice, wisdom and
peace must go hand in hand by all the people and for all the people. There is a fine sky
scene besides.</p>

<p>How remarkable are the strong outlines as interestingly touched up by
creative imagery! Oh, yes, we believe in true freedom as well as in all human
rights. I tell you, you are destined to wield political influence. Fear not,
though there is to be very great commotion and strife, as to some bodies of
beliefs joining forces, There is in evidence a serious national gulf, for a
period, See the <i>seething mass
</i>below? Yet the large, waving flag is in the
midst of it all. See how its ample folds cover
the little people! Woman comes into full
evidence with man and victory squares these
and banners. Now, see you the large moon-faced man from over the deep water? Behold
the many little people. These represent, without doubt, the toiling masses. See them look
to our great flag, Uncle Sam and America.
See the guns they leave behind, though they appear well armed by some firm revolves.
Some power crowned is near death's gates.
There is some peril on the other shores and on
this, yet the links for chains of co-operation
come later on. First, there are spears, guns,
rasping files; secret orders, too, which shall in
due time become fully known to Uncle Sam,
for, see you the boxes and the broken lines,
like a serpent yet, living cables with its intricate workings. I am stirred by its forces, now
international. Oh, yes, you could learn to read
by concentration of mind. This is the first
time this great combination has been presented
to me. Your special auras and the cosmic
direction in present era of human action have
aided in portraying these objects. Life is full
of signs of the times. You are thinkers.</p>

<p>No doubt the reader is, at times, largely
dominated by the enquirer, though you now
prefer to learn of finances. The large fish is
in evidence, however, not yet at hand. Clouds
obscure desires. You will be thrust into this
exciting national and more equal-rights work,
with several men of distinction. See the
breast-plates and medallions. This is a suggestive and interesting chapter to me and
requires study to apply.</p>

<p>Do you grasp some of the leading ideas?
Hold them fast, to appropriate as you advance
into the vortex of deeper action. See how the
steepled church is in evidence. Not so wonderful. Many things photograph themselves
for further reading by observation. We are
yet in the very infancy of comprehending
cause and effect.</p>

<p><i>Kismet!</i> I detest war, yet mankind is destined to thus make the annals of future history
more complete in equity and in fraternal
justice to humanity. Let us prove that the
world is really advancing. This is the fierce
and fermenting time, the entire world's chemicalizing process. We may all learn from the
great book of life.</p>


<p>Though many noble souls seem vanquished,
each actor shall be his own, yet united historian.</p>

<p>Thank you. Readings of this character are
instructive, even to skeptics. Wish we could
all read and retain each helpful part. As one
thinks on these lines the fuller atmospheric
waves become laden with blessings. The Good
Book says, "Ask and ye shall receive," so, ask
in wisdom and in faith. You are now charged
with the desires. Perhaps I do inspire inquiry. Look at these lines of chairs in this fine toss,
also men.</p>

<p>Birds again--rows of singing birds, and flowers, too--joyous
expectations. Man with baton--musical matters, attended by audiences.
You either are in full touch with singers, or
certainly will be. The swing up high is a fine
sign. Follow it up with courage, The double
triangle, the long road and the unobscured
star are before you. These promise you honors
and fame. You will know the art of growing
old sweetly.</p>

<p>See the gallery of pictures you have collected. The park and the people, too!</p>

<p>Heaven has blessed you with mental gifts and spiritual graces in the
glorious, ever present, because of your doing things with no
dreaded to-morrow. This is a superb final, for
the light lines are within your daily duties.
You will travel together in close relationship--husband and wife, and begin anew very nearly
at the same time. It is really an inspiring text.
Thus do we learn to know each other in one
little hour of life as fulfilling worthy purposes
by every act divine.</p>

<br>
<center>CHAPTER IV.
<br>
<br>
MYSTICAL CUP.</center>

<p>Touching, no doubt, on the death of Pope Leo, as also on some one of the
present party somehow connected with nobility. See you the ocean? </p>
<p>Here is a kingly form, robed and crowned, yet standing with arms and hands
filled, symbolizing someone with great plenty in foreign lands. At the feet,
a severed circle, some disordered boxes, a pair of large, closed shears pointing
toward another commanding form, though obstacles lie between them. Also a
crouching form, in part human, with large eyes, and now, on his back a weighty
something, facing the less pretentious forms, one of whom is bowed by some new
disappointment, being near a fallen wall. Some one in mental suffering, as
thorns crown one of the lesser heads, facing a distant city. Some hidden
wrongs are to become manifest.</p>

<p>See the army of men in disorder! Soldiers are in line, too, with horsemen
from all sides of the land and waters. Dread dismay, yet with keen-edged
expectancy in evidence. Behind the kingly form there is a tower--strength--
though there is the unlighted torch at the top. Some large bird in
the back scene will venture into peril. Near the shaft at its base are caverns.
On closer inspection you can see the vapors arising. You see the entire world
appears interested--so many heads of men.</p>

<p>One of the party had expected some special news from distant lands, saying:
"Verily, the atmosphere is filled with these things,"--Auto thought or
otherwise. Secrets after all are not so hidden, though I believe this reading to
pertain largely to the city of Rome, the Vatican palace and famed historical
Tiber.</p>

<p>You see, we have all been reading the news. We are in this floating ether of
thoughts, no matter what little wishes we have of our own. Our untutored minds
cannot yet apply some of these lessons. Everything is in form atmospheric, to be
photographed for tangibleness to our crude senses. How then can we be held in
blame for the committal of even some desperate acts? Are we not at the perpetual
mercy of evil men and powers, which blind fair reason?</p>

<p>Listen, friends, are there not better objects everywhere? Yet modest things
are apt to be overlooked. Are we not dazzled by pomp and show? Did we not all
cry out, "Oh, what a wonderful cup--a king, a king with a crown?" We must not
allow our morals to thus easily hang like conventional cowards. This cup of the
king's is full of strife. Numerous virtues are not observed.</p>

<p>See the little tables and the tender vines so choked by grasses, even modest
flowers by the fallen walls! Let us note these, yet glory and pomp are man's
highest aim in life. I say we should all become a freer people, but we are
flattered by show and even despotism. I behold wonderful promises.</p>

<p>This strong trail is for a long time. See the cutting instruments again. The
rasp and the little scissors shadowed beneath the larger symbols. Behold the
bed-rock, with crevices to catch the feet, and here, a small road comes near a
tunnel, looking ambitiously towards the large avenue where splendor, prestige
and power are seen. See modern fashion so careless of the rights of
others--these poor little people. Yes, I will describe some of these figures, to
teach, if so we may, a bit of entertaining, benevolent sense.</p>

<p>Again, look at this upper row of soldiers, machine-made men. See the
trumpets, I can almost hear their blast, and see the dust and life-blood of
degrading, cruel wars, which impoverish and grind into filth the entire
afflicted human race, though there are very excellent people of wealth, were
there to wisely co-operate. There is some promise in this reading. If rich men
could become active benefactors--see the little banners--wars would at once
end, and the Christ would live with mankind.</p>

<br>

<center>MINISTER'S SPEECH.</center>

<p>I cannot believe that a loving, merciful God bids man to further wars, strife
and blood-shed for mere aggrandizement. It is really a libel on all progress,
grace and moral justice. The God and dear Saviors whom I love and honor are not
monsters of cruel vengeance. There exist so many excellent signs of the good
time to dawn on the human race, when the tidal wave once really sets into
combined, perpetual motion. Let us all desire to thus aid the race along these
lines, or in whatsoever ways we can.</p>

<p>I am forever indebted to a dear, high-souled lady, who loved young folks, for
my first deep moral thought-lessons in cupology, and in character readings.
Life-long impressions and aids have these brought to many others, in this
high-art sensing of human needs, therefore let us supply an atmosphere in which
good thoughts can germinate, believing that nature has a bank which is a sure
one that can never break. A bank of full justice; life's worthy inheritance;
your acts.</p>

<p>Now friends, this collection may end my readings briefly. In order to learn
one must teach. No, I have not added some of those special past verifications. I
try to study the lesser forms as well as the prominent ones to cultivate patient
sensing. Observe your feelings towards your friends or pupils. Be honest,
sincere, and sympathetic in heart to heart talks. Hold confidence reposed as a
sacred gift. That is one of the secrets of friendship and success in every walk
through life. Let us believe it so.</p>

<center>FIRE IN VATICAN.
<br>
<br>
BURNS PART OF LIBRARY WITH BARE AND ANCIENT BOOKS.</center>

<p>That portion of the Vatican containing the hall of the inscriptions, where
the Pope gives his audiences, and which is adjacent to the famous and precious
pinacoteca, or gallery of pictures, was burned Sunday. The smoke and flames were
seen from a mile distant.</p>

<p>The first intimation of fire was had when smoke was seen issuing from the
apartment of M. Mario, which is located above that of Father Earl, the
librarian, who lives over the library. M. Mario is a celebrated French restorer
of ancient manuscripts and illuminated books. He has been engaged in copying
work, and his first reproductions have been selected for part of the Vatican's
exhibit at the St. Louis exposition. It is supposed that M. Mario forgot to take
proper precautions with his kitchen fire, which probably blazed up and ignited
some nearby hangings.</p>

<p>The entire museum of inscriptions, the rooms of Father Earl, part of the
library and the printing houses were entirely flooded with water.</p>

<p>It is impossible to reach even an approximate idea of the extent of damage.
Many articles were saved, including some ancient and very valuable arms which
were recently moved to the library from the Borgia apartment in order to make
room for the new residence of the papal secretary of state.</p>

<p>Many things that escaped the flames were injured by water, especially the
precious private library of Pope Leo.</p>

<p>The above clipping verifies the reading of the King's cup.</p>

<br>
THE ACQUISITIVE ADEPT.<br>
<br>
BY A BRIGHT GIRL OF SEVENTEEN</center>

<p>Dear lady, this is not as I should like to promise. You have suffered deeply.
Here are dark caverns, crosses, confusion and wavy, broken and crooked lines. No
good luck to be foretold. So it appears on the surface. You are overcast by
sorrow and losses, with death to many present hopes. As holding up the cup,
gravestones, tears--heart-tears--seems an ill-omened cup, yet no one need to be
discouraged.</p>

<p>I can now reveal to you, even in this conclusive reading, one fair
remaining sky-scene, with a little sun-burst, and a distant square. Examine,
also, below the tangled rubbish. See you the head of the little anchor, like
some friend in need. Trust still in the good, and such will come to you. </p>
<p>Let no one say they are doomed. This lady is well along in years, therefore,
this one fair spot of sky-scene is large enough to fill in the remaining periods
with joy and hope. I am not content to skim over the mere surface. Helpful
revelations need the deeper, mental searchlight.</p>

<p>By turning this cup from left to right, the symbols shadow forth a peaceful
old age, up near the sky-light and the evening star. The dots, with little
rings--some kindly aid until the close, with loving, retrospective hope in the
final All Good.</p>

<p>I feel your deep enthusiasms, my friend. God's blessings on you, dear child.
You thrill my soul with expectant gladness.</p>

<p>It proved that a benevolent Boston family opened their hospitable doors to
this lovely old lady amid her deepest dilemmas. Also, a small inheritance came
to this star-lit dome of her declining life's protection.</p>

<center>A WOMAN'S WINNING CARD.</center>

<p>A woman's winning card is cheerfulness.</p>

<p>She may be capable of countless self-sacrifices, infinite tenderness and
endless resources of wisdom, but if she cloaks these very excellent
possessions under a garb of melancholy she may almost as well not have them, so
far as the ordinary world is concerned.</p>

<br>
THE FICKLE TRIO--SOCIAL WHIRLWINDS.</center>

<p>You say, "Tell us all you see." Young ladies, there is a mixed-up state of
affairs, yet one must use good judgment, so steady your minds for correct
appreciation of the kindness of your near associates and friends. These Fourths
of July mental pyrotechnics are not safe playthings, my dear young friends. Here
are outlined so many love gifts, with pleasures too short-lived. You are
pain-giving iconoclasts.</p>

<p>Heart-breakers, said the three, laughing.</p>

<p>You have spoken correctly, for here are broken, also incomplete circles and
squares. These imperfect lines so near the life symbols <i>key and wish</i> with
shattered urns and crushed flowers. Ah! and here are some blighted trees! This
is both the spring time of your lives as of the seasons, so have care for the
sad heart tears you cause and will reap. Lives are oft thus crushed. You are
acting your funny parts as now you think.</p>

<p>"Know thyself," young man. Trifle not with the happy, little blonde lady,
whose widowed mother passes sleepless nights thinking of her two pretty
daughters. Neither be too attentive to the young matron, whose master carries
the dagger by his side. L. and H. seem not good letters of names nor localities
for you. Yet, you possess some fine mental gifts. Good books are near.</p>

<p>You girls will soon drift apart by a stolen letter and some dark cloud of
distrust, though you will need each other. See you the separate roads, with the
harsh wind blowing the leafless branches of the trees? and yet near by shines
the beautiful meadow, just beyond your present thoughts. Strive to cultivate
more of the duties of needed practical life and hopes. These high thought
signs will not serve you, when life's autumn comes.</p>

<p>Now listen, little Brunette. Accept the old love in about two years. He
will return to you from a distance. You smile, yet you will not wed with any one
now associated. Do not, then, deceive him. He is keen of mind and heart. See,
his sky is clear, and the ring of promise is in the light.</p>

<p>Yes, we can now see these outlines. You are a psychologist. You make us see
them, as you desire, young man. Note you their forthcoming. I cannot impel
these realities. Emma is the good name of your best friend, young man. She loves
you thoughtfully. Cultivate her rare graces. The mirror is clear that is near
her home. The birds sing and the children are joyful. Fine symbols. The
home-garden, too, is beautiful. Let us trace the lines. The old, sick lady,
inmate of the home will die in the Autumn. That will be a decisive change for
that family. Do not allow them to pass out of your kindly care, if real friends
you would possess. Lives can be strangely made or unmade oft times. One must be
wise in order to be happy. These pitchers, with stout handles, as here seen,
signify some lucky circumstances. The supposed wealth of this globe-trotting,
dark clothed lady friend is to have a big fall. See the objects! The trunks
are all upset and she is in ill temper and very self-willed. See the head? A
mule is near her.</p>

<p>How curiously you read some of these things. I shall note them more fully,
though you do not compliment us three at all. Are we, then, so soulless in our
innocent pleasures? Pray, tell.</p>

<p>I but delineate some truths as your benefactor, and as I am given them for
each. You all love popularity and excitement. </p>
<p>Oh, yes, things appear true in part, as to a few simple things, yet it is
very pleasant to hear you read these fanciful figures. I know the lady Emma,
also the worrysome, aged, sick woman. I expect an upset at her death, yet we
hope for good results, though you promise me irritating labors by this
looked-for change.</p>

<p>How amusing this big frog, the magician or joker, as you term him. I did not
know the tad-pole was so gifted.</p>

<p>Some months later proves the death, and several of the stated events more
than verified. With the young folks asking eager questions, the clouds had
gathered. The lame man came into view. The good time not yet. Confusion and
discord revealing some added cares as threaded together by the symbols as
previously shown, and from the note-book of the young man. The hated lame man of
letters having rudely flustrated the game of their lives, yet he was just,
though believed to be the cruel enemy, from the broken, wavy lines and cutting
things about him, then facing towards them. Mental reason, or impressment plying
its parts as touching these mingled, and confusion atmospheres, proving that
all things affect us, consciously or otherwise, relating to life.</p>

<p>These intricate and wonderful relationships--these cosmic laws--bind all
mankind together for better or, more often, for needless sorrow and trials. Yet
here was some good side to these life-lines, for their own choosing, had each
been more unselfish and just. Are we, then, arbiters of our own fate? It is
still an open question to many, though there is a time for all things.</p>

<br>

<center>LET US NOT BE FATALISTS.</center>

<p>We must seize the handle of the subject, when the door is waiting to open.
Each association makes some conditions, brief or life-long. We are not bound
to be enslaved forever, though nothing pays but justice, kindness, patience
and useful duty, if peace we would enjoy here or hereafter.</p>

<br>

<center>IN THE CHRIST SPIRIT.</center>

<p>There is at least one good, guardian angel ever ready to aid in each life, my
dear young friends. One of these ladies did marry that mentioned first love
after many sad disappointments, with little intrigues, as afterward she said:
"Be neither too fickle, too self-opinionated, nor too <i>submissive</i>. Be
something useful. Learn to reason with head, heart and soul.&quot; The young man is
still plodding on in pessimism. This best friend Emma is still alone, yet
working out some of the noble purposes of her helpful, progressive life, knowing
that "her own will surely come to her" some good time, and that this brief
school-life is not the end of anything nobly sought for. Simulating big things
allowed the young man to belittle many noble facts in nature, thus stunting his
manly growth, and overgrowing this chilling pessimism with smart retorts.</p>

<p>One really desiring to aid humanity can become inspired into consistent
kindness, well centered in the lines of forecast, as also in the cup reading
pleasure. So observe the figures, point them out, summing up as these gems of
thought come to life. One too lazy or disobliging cannot grow these many
latent powers. These are as yet but dimly apprehended. All persons possess some
special gift. God meant it so, and that we give hope and joy in all honest ways.
So try your gift in this mingling of your aspirations for lofty expressions,
which transmit pleasing convictions, strange as at first these may appear. Each
soul, as reading or listening, creates an atmosphere of either flippancy,
depression, courage, trust, or some vital power.</p>

<p>Some persons there are, who make us feel happy and well by simply looking at
us, or thinking of us, with that subtle power that cures one of melancholia,
discouragement, or irritability. Writing a letter with a soul is good. You know
there is the soul of things, a fact in nature. I know of many cases, on turning
backward in memory's pages. One special one of a dear musical friend, who became
very ill from over-work, with nervous headache and sick stomach, so that all
hope of an expected musical evening had to be abandoned, as she took her bed
in disgust, with sore disappointment. About an hour later, not entirely
unexpected, there called at her home a beloved brother, whose melodious voice in
song proved to the lady better than any medicine, as he quietly sat down to the
piano to sing that sweetly pathetic song:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Only waiting till the shadows<br>Have a little longer grown."</p></blockquote>

<p>Hark? said the sick lady quickly sitting up at hearing the first notes. Oh,
that is my dear brother, Peter--his name signifieth Lord. Please aid me to
dress. I am really better, I am, indeed, do not fear. I must go down to hear him
sing. His charming voice has lifted me into strength. I will take the tea.
Though very pale, she entertained that evening, and even sang, until midnight.
Not one of the party at that time was a Christian Science believer either.</p>

<p>We are only in the kindergarten of life. Some time we shall all possess the
high art of selecting our friends and our life companions, my dear, eager,
anxious inquirers. We have power in ourselves to grow. This was simply an
unadulterated fact, proving the power of mind, soul and spirit on itself from
the stimulus of the brother; there being also very much efficacy in the
harmony of tones as well as of personality. I wish more persons could be
conscious of the power of the voice on the actions of all we come in contact
with. We are now touching but slightly on the esoteric, as carnal desires are
yet in full evidence.</p>

<p>I have now in mind a sensitive lad of fourteen, who, after four trying
years ran away from a really good home and a step-mother, because of her harsh
tones. Though a good woman, his soul-life seemed to suffer.</p>

<p>"The way she says things," said he, "is awful to something in me, so that
I want to fight. I can't help but shiver. Oh, I don't know what it is. I want to
be good. I know she does some nice things."</p>

<p>Though the young philosopher chose for himself a severe taskmaster, with
plenty of added work, yet, with some special kindliness in trustful tones that
proved part-pay, some needed, minor chord was touched in the soul-life of the
lad, that gave him hope in himself and in his future, which proved very true. He
has long been a kind and useful citizen, in precepts for the young, and an
object lesson to many. A practical, reasoning benefactor of the race, as was the
kindly Charles Dickens in the interest of child-life. So let us work. These
times are infinitely larger, broader, and more full of promise to the world.</p>

<p>Our musical friend has left the shadows that were then gathering about her
life. Gone into the more perfect light and life of her true inheritance, with
God the loving parent of all human and divine joys.</p>

<center>CHAPTER VII.
<br>
<br>
SUPERSTITION</center>

<p>Do not hold to cowardice nor fear of death. The mad bull with the spade stands
near by. Look into this strange cup of figures and graves. Some recent death and
gloom has somehow filled your mind with renewed horror. You have also felt that
you are about to die. Not a comfortable thought, madam, to be snuffed out of all
earthly hopes! Abandon your cringing fears. Dread nothing. You must gain
mastery over these crude forebodings, or you will be seriously handicapped.
Most discouraging is fear. The spirit of conscious life cannot
be annihilated. Man is immortal. We should not doubt the word of God nor His prophecies.</p>

<p>Towers, trees, and large scenes are in evidence to aid you into a larger
life career.</p>

<p>See you now the rubbish by the grave! enough to hopelessly entangle you. See
the many wild animals in your path near the dung heap. Again the tears and the
fears. You do not stand erect. Your ideas of the after-life seem to belie your
professed creeds. One of your sincere friends and true helpers requests my
candid service in your behalf as noting your vibrations. Thank you.</p>

<p>I will now proceed further with your sanction. Listen well: You belong to a
class who would send dinamic heart-beats to disturb your entire bodily system on
the subject of death. Were it a necessity to perform even some slight operation,
your death in this state might easily ensue from very fear.</p>

<p>Madam, how is one to overcome nature? I do not brag on my heroism as others
do. I do fear death, the devil and his imps. I have often dreamed of him as
pursuing me. There must be something to it, as my father believed likewise. I
want the good time of life here. We don't know of the hereafter as promised.</p>

<p>Young man, your birth-right, your reason and education are at fault, if
nineteen years of life's action has brought you no solace. You are not in life's
true logic, nor is the profession of law well chosen for you by your relatives,
neither is the ministry.</p>

<p>You now think you are in love with a good young girl. How will you comfort
her when sorrows come to you? She, too, fears death and pain beyond the
ordinary. A pair of simple young folks, indeed, both of you.</p>

<p>See, in this last cup the flame of destruction has come. You have both lost
your heads. Death and loss have invaded the home. Everything is scattered
about. No reason nor care remains. Indecision, crosses, and breaks are in
promise. The good symbols are yet distant, though inviting you to their ample
folds. You need first to be whipped into life's truer graces, as oft we are.
Your parents were weak, sympathetic and selfish.</p>

<p>There were five of you in family. The figure in first cup was correct, though
not an old man there, that is three years past! and the one-armed man! that
was long ago, too. Yes, but his letters yet lie near your family thoughts. Do
not lose them, there is value attached. Yet there are imprisoned minds who do
not know their real possessions. Now, these bars and unformed circles bespeak
it. Behold the light on the obscure desk in the old square.</p>

<p>Oh yes, he was cheated out of his rights, years ago, yet father keeps the
letters. There is nothing in them now.</p>

<p>Yes there is, several years hence, by the death of a child and a lost woman
from near an ocean city. News sudden will come to you. Let your fancy
concentrate a little on these letters.</p>

<p>How peculiar! There was one who died by water, that was a family connection.</p>

<p>You have now had three readings. Hold your true texts in mind. Fear nothing
but injustice. You will be tested. You will yet love the ocean, even the
lightning's fierce flashes, though after sudden peril and loss you will make
acquaintance with your higher self--not be so selfish nor material. Eight years
of strange wanderings with indecision and betrayal by a false black hand, as
shown you. Several gravestones and some sickness. After these experiences you
will awaken from some of life's medley of dreams and fears. You will then meet a
strong, true woman, who will dominate much of your nobler, latent life, and
aid you into position, if you do not mar your life's course in about three
years. Your hand reads likewise. In this last cup of yours are spears and weeds,
with knives and hidden crosses. Your dangers, as here read, are very many.</p>

<p>There are so many small lives filled with idleness, though some useful
objects could oft be reached. Yours is largely among these. Yet I am pleased to
state you could yet become a fine mind and life trainer by the age of forty, if
wise enough to select your true helpers--good books. No one can work
effectively alone. My mind has traveled with you up to these years, viewed the
field of resource and its possibilities. You should win two helpful friends.</p>

<p>Only one comprehensive life-course reading has shown this entire evening. We
do not gain the high art of holding the good which we gain, so profligate are
we. Then we like to blame our friends or the fates for our poor judgment and our
obtuseness. Until we begin to work as though we belong to and believe in an
immortal life, as an inheritance, the great human family cannot enjoy that
useful cohesion that belongs to mankind as God designed life's
distributives--our higher attributes.</p>

<p>Again, shun the man with the fire-arms and bottles. Behold the weapons. The
dark pit lies near him with many cross-bars, cages and clouds. An evil
combination--<i>imprisonment</i>, though your sunlight has only been dimmed. If so,
your will, patient labor and strong desire can yet win for you. The flag of
victory is now so limp. This fear of kindly death or hell is the enemy of
mankind. Do not again thus cringe to this fair angel of life to all men
eventually. You can live to old age and follow streams, fishing as pastime. This
old man symbolizes your dear self now calmed in mind--not so dead as in youth.
So, hold your true texts for ready action, and become a brave man to enjoy the
true life here promised to you.</p>

<p>If we have stimulated in any heart some lofty resolves, which will unfold
their fragrance for other lives, we are then well repaid, as trusting in the
Infinite All Good.</p>

of the desert and the plain; that turns the
moist furrow in the spring in order that all the world may have abundant
harvests; that furnishes the sport of Kings; that with blazing
eye and distended nostril, fearlessly leads our
greatest Generals through carnage and the
smoke of battle to glory and renown; whose
blood forms one of the ingredients that go to
make the ink in which all history is written,

<center>A HINT ON ENTERTAINING.</center>

<p>"The most successful social functions are
those managed by a host and hostess," says a
society scribe, "not by either alone. Leave a
man to make up a party and he is sure to
forget that Mrs. B. was engaged to C. before
she married D., and that Mrs. C. is aware of
the fact, and that the D.s and E.s have long
been at daggers drawn, and he will have no
eyes to detect the designs of Mrs. H. On
the other hand, a woman gets nervous and
fatigued with the constant effort to keep the
ball rolling, and fails just where a man
would succeed. What is wanted is a division
of labor, and if this were done oftener there
would be less disappointment on the part of
entertainers and entertained.&quot;</p>

<center>LOOK AT YOUR CUP.</center>

<p>A cup of coffee, farmers assert, makes a
pretty accurate barometer:</p>

<p>"To make a barometer out of a cup of
coffee," a farmer said, "you must use loaf
sugar. You drop a lump of this sugar exactly
into the middle of your cup, and then watch the bubbles rise. It is by these bubbles that
your prognostications are made.</p>

<p>"If the bubbles rise straight up in the middle, remaining there in a cluster till they
disappear, the weather is to be fair; if they
rise at the sides of the cup, adhering to the
china, the weather will be rainy. If they rise
all over the coffee's surface, and move here
and there erratically, changeable conditions are
to be looked for."</p>

<br>
<center>ENTERTAINMENT SUGGESTION.</center>

<p>Here are some ideas for an entertainment,
which is said to be both amusing and instructive, as it makes one think, and the time put
into anything that makes men or women think
is never lost. Have an art gallery and invite
your friends to it. Each person is supplied
with a catalogue and must pay a forfeit for
every piece of art he fails to find. Here is a
sample of the catalogue:</p>

<p>1. The Bell of the Season. (A dinner bell.)<br>
2. Saved. (A bank containing a few pennies.)<br>
3. An Absorbing Subject. (A sponge.)<br>
4. A Drawing Subject. (A crayon.)<br>
5. The Skipper's Home. (Cheese.)<br>
6. A Young Man's Horror. (The mitten.)<br>
7. The Light of Other Days. (A candle.)<br>
8. Tears, Idle Tears. (An onion.)<br>
9. Can't be Beat. (A turnip.)<br>
10. The Four Seasons. (Salt, pepper, vinegar and mustard.)<br>
11. A Regular Bore. (A gimlet.)<br>
12. Family Jars. (Mason's fruit jars in three sizes.)<br>
13. True to the Core. (An apple.)<br>
14. A Prison Scene. (A mouse in a trap.)<br>
15. A Switchtender. (A hairpin.)<br>
16. A Bunch of Dates. (A calendar.)</p>

<p>Of course, no one speaks in the art room.</p>

<p>Every guest fills in what names he can, hoping
that his friends will miss many more than he
does. Have ten or more "pieces of art" than
are on the catalogue. This is to mystify a
little.</p>

<center>HAVE A PEANUT?</center>


<p>An original young woman of Lamar has
invented a new kind of social diversion. It is
the "progressive peanut party." Four guests
are seated about each table, and on the table is placed a crock full of peanuts. Each guest
is provided with a hatpin, and when the word
is given all begin jabbing for peanuts. The
quartet that empties its crock first wins the
game, and then the sets of players change. It
is needless to say that the peanut party is
strictly a "hen" function. A man couldn't
jab a crockful of peanuts with a hatpin in a
week, but the young women of Lamar played
thirty games in a single afternoon.--<i>Kansas

<center>WHAT THE EYES TELL.</center>

<p>The color of the eyes has hitherto chiefly
concerned the novelist and the poet, but lately
the cold-blooded statistician has been looking
into them. It is announced that, taking the
average of Europe and America, 44.6 per cent
of men have light eyes, including blue and
gray. The proportion of women having blue
or gray eyes is 32.2 per
cent. In other words,
blue eyes are decidedly rarer among women
than among men, says the <i>London Express</i>.</p>

<p>Men have light eyes oftener than women,
but in the intermediate shades between light and dark the percentage of the two sexes is
very nearly the same.</p>

<p>In this intermediate category are brown and
hazel eyes. The percentage of these among
men is 43.1, and among women 45.1.</p>

<p>The percentage of black eyes is larger among
women than among men, being 20.7 per cent
for the women, while among men it is 12.3.</p>

<p>Blue eyes are considered to possess great
attractions. This was the case among the
Greeks and Romans of classic times. Upon
the Goddess of Minerva was bestowed a surname to signify the blueness of her eyes.</p>

<p>Gray eyes have ever been the ideal of all
great novelists; among the number Charlotte
Brontë, George Eliot, Wilkie Collins and
Charles Reade. Most of the heroines in up-to-date fiction
are gray-eyed maidens.</p>

<p>Of the living great, as well as the famous
dead, most have eyes of gray blue.</p>

<p>Shakespeare had eyes of gray; so had nearly
all the English poets. Coleridge's eyes were
large, light gray, prominent and of liquid brilliancy. Byron's eyes were gray, fringed with
long black lashes.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb's glittering eyes were strangely
dissimilar in color, one being hazel, the other having specks of gray in the iris. Chatterton's
brilliant gray eyes were his most remarkable
features. Under strong excitement one appeared brighter and larger than the other.</p>

<p>As to green eyes they are for glory. The
Empress Catherine of Russia had eyes of this
hue. In Don Quixote green eyes are thus
referred to:</p>

<p>"But, now I think on it, Sancho, thy description of her beauty was a little absurd in
that particular of comparing her eyes to pearls. Sure, such eyes are more like
those of a whiting or a seabeam than those of a fair lady, and
in my opinion, Dulcinea's eyes are rather like
two celestial emeralds, railed in with two
celestial arches, which signify her eyebrows.
Therefore, Sancho, you had better take your
pearls from her eyes and apply them to her
teeth." Green eyes are not popular, however.
Cervantes spoke of them as "verdant emeralds," that more usually they are likened to
the optics of the cat. Very few heroines have
green eyes. Jane Eyre and Rose, in Robert
Elsmere, are the only two we can think of at
the moment.</p>

<br>
<center>REVEALED BY THE THUMB.</center>

<p>The thumb is a great tell-tale where character is concerned. If nose, eyes and mouth
decline to reveal the secrets or temperament,
you need not be at a loss. Notice the hands,
and especially the thumb of the person whom
you are seeking to read.</p>

<p>A broad and short thumb indicates lack of
refinement. Taken in conjunction with stubby finger tips and a thick wrist, it
indicates coarseness, even positive brutality.</p>

<p>A tapering thumb gives notice of extreme
delicacy of perception and refinement of character.</p>

<p>A thumb of medium
breadth indicates balance between the extremes mentioned, and
denotes strength of character essential to success in life.</p>

<p>If when in repose the thumb curls outward,
its owner possesses a sound constitution, much
vitality and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the thumb naturally falls
inward towards the palm, a melancholy, despondent disposition is
denoted, also constitutional delicacy and lack of vitality.</p>

<a name="17"></a>
<br>
<br>
<center>CHARACTERS IN FINGER NAILS.</center>

<p>Broad nails denote a gentle natured person,
inclined to be modest and unassuming.</p>

<p>Narrow nails denote a studious but not very
gentle nature, with a desire for scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p>White nails denote a fondness for society of
opposite sex, not overstrong in health and subject to fevers.</p>

<p>Round nails denote a desire for knowledge
in general, apt to take great pride in own
accomplishments, rather hasty, yet fairly good
natured and forgiving.</p>

<p>Long nails denote caution, lacking confidence
in human nature, decided in opinion and
strictly virtuous.</p>

<p>Eyes are cold, enticing, sympathetic or affectionate. The mouth is kissable (as men
say), cynical, cruel, sensuous or indifferent, and
so with all the features.</p>

<center>BEAUTY'S SEVEN NURSES.</center>

<p>Beauty, it is said, has seven nurses, which, if
given full charge, will make of the homeliest
woman a picture of charm and loveliness.</p>

<p>These magic seven are fresh air, sunshine,
warmth, rest, sleep, food and whatever stirs the blood, be it exercise or
enthusiasm.</p><p>Be sure to get plenty of sleep. You can
sleep yourself into good looks. A long nap
and a hot bath will make any woman more
attractive, and lift years from her shoulder.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of sunshine and fresh air.
They offer you bloom and color. And deep
breathing is surely the hand-maid of the fresh-air nurse. Deep breathing gives a fine figure
as well as clear complexion.</p>

<p>Don't sit down to table as soon as you come
in from work, or a round of social duties. Lie
down, or sit down, for ten minutes, waiting
until you can partake of your dinner with the
physical machinery rested and refreshed.</p>

<p>Don't bathe in hard water. Soften it with a
little powdered borax, or a handful of oatmeal.</p>

<p>Don't bathe the face while it is very warm, or very cold.</p>

<p>Don't wash the face when traveling, unless it
is with a little alcohol and water, or a little
cold cream.</p>

<p>Don't attempt to remove dust with cold
water. Give the face a hot bath with soap, and then rinse thoroughly with clear tepid or cold
water.</p>

<p>Don't rub the face with too coarse a towel. Treat it as you would
the finest porcelain, tenderly and delicately.--<i>Philadelphia Telegraph</i>.</p>

<br>
<center>TO DISCOVER A WOMAN'S AGE.</center>

<p>Every man seems to be born with a desire
to know the age of the ladies with whom he
comes in contact, and women also appear to
have an innate curiosity concerning the number of "summers" which have passed over the
heads of their female friends. But there is
nothing more difficult to discover than the
exact age of a lady who wishes to keep the fact
a secret.</p>

<p>Now, here is a little scheme by which you
can find out the age of any person.</p>

<p>Having engaged that person in pleasant
conversation, you proceed something after the
following manner--speaking very innocently,
of course:--</p>

<p>"There is a very simple problem in arithmetic which very
few people are able to see through, yet it is as easy as possible. I wonder
if you can do it?"</p>

<p>This sets the person on his dignity, and he
or she wants to do it at once.</p>

<p>Then you go on:</p>

<p>"Think of a number corresponding to the
numerical order of the month in which you
were born. Oh, no, you need not tell me."</p>

<p>(To make the explanation clear, we will
assume that the figure is two--standing for
February--and that the age is 30.)</p>

<p>&quot;Now, multiply that figure by 2,&quot; you
continue, "and add 5. Done that? Well, multiply that by 50 and add your own age.-- From
the total subtract 365, and to the total add
115. Now, what figure have you got?"</p>

<p>"230,&quot; replies the person addressed, "Isn't
that correct?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," you exclaim, "You are one of
the very few persons who have managed it."</p>

<p>And you turn away to hide your smile of
satisfaction at having discovered that your victim was born in February and that he is thirty
years of age. You have arrived at this result
by separating the figures 230 into 2 (February)
and 30. And you can do this with everybody's
age. Try it on your sweetheart.--<i>Tit-Bit</i>.</p>

<center>HOW HE MAY BE WON.</center>

<p>Some men have been found courageous
enough to express themselves on the subject, &quot;How to win a man.&quot; Here are the
requirements from a masculine point of view for
winning a man worth having. The summer
girl should cut this out and paste it on her
mirror:</p>

<p>Be natural, be extremely fastidious in choosing friends, in conversation, in manners, and
in dress.</p>

<p>Be neat, for the well-groomed woman,
though plain, is more attractive than the slovenly beauty.</p>

<p>Be cheerful and fun-loving, be kind, unselfish, sympathetic and affectionate.</p>

<p>Be interested in everything that will improve
your mind and broaden your views.</p>

<p>Be orderly, systematic, and industrious, but
do not waste time on non-essentials. Good
reading is far better than useless fancy work.</p>

<p>Be domestic and home-loving, secure as
much knowledge as possible concerning house-hold affairs, and do not be ashamed to use it.</p>

<p>Be athletic enough to keep in fine physical
condition and just manly enough to be self-reliant and courageous,
but not so independent as to forget for one moment that you are a
woman.</p>

<p>Cultivate a liking for children and old people,
for you must remember that you have been the
one and will be the other if you live long
enough.</p>

<p>Do not appear to be superior, even if you
know that you are, one can easily be mistaken
on this point.</p>

<p>Do not be conceited or vain, do not be silly
or gushing, or too eager.</p>

<p>Do not be late and yet do not waste time in
being too early; study repose of manner, it is
so restful to tired nerves.</p>

<p>Do not nag either before or after he is won;
the "I told you so" has lost many a friend and
lover.</p>

<p>Be frank, and truthful and forgiving, and
remember that forgetting must often go with
forgiving. This, of course, is the ideal woman,
but the standard is not too high for any girl to
strive for.--<i>Philadelphia Telegraph</i>.</p>

<center>DEW DROPS.</center>

<p>Wisdom is the flower of experience.</p>

<p>Hope is good, but hustle is better.</p>

<p>Energy, however, usually follows encouragement.</p>

<p>A soft answer sootheth, but a wise one
shameth.</p>

<p>The genius never regarded as a crank is yet
to be born.</p>

<p>Do as I say, not as I do: Preaching love with
a jealous heart.</p>

<p>To move through the world without the dissent of others: Be temperate and pay your
debts.</p>

<p>Happiness is not so difficult to obtain as to
retain.</p>

<p>Who will not work without pay should also
be consistent enough to refuse pay without
work.</p>

<p>Heart and head are two masters who may be
served by one hand.</p>

<p>Human deification, permitted or self implied,
is an offense against Deity.</p>

<center>BIRTH STONES FOR LUCK.</center>

<p>Do you want that mysterious thing that is
called "good luck?" Of course you do. Then
in some form or another you must always wear
your birth stone. This is declared to be, by
the superstitious, a true talisman against all
the ills that flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>Upon her finger in a handsome ring the
very modern girl wears the stone that means
good omen to her, and feels that she is secure
from harm. If it is not in a little golden circlet upon her hand, then perchance she wears
it at her throat, in one of the little dingle dangles that are so fashionable. But about her
neck, in her fob, or bangle, the lass who wishes
to cast a spell of good fortune about herself,
somewhere wears the stone that is assigned to
the month in which she first saw the light of
day.</p>

<p>In what month were you born? Do you
know what is your birth stone? If you do not
you better at once discover the stone and begin
to wear it. That is, if you wish good luck, and
what maiden ever lived who does not sigh for
it.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the gems, and the months to which they are assigned by those soothtellers
who know all the signs for luck, good or ill: For January, garnet; February, amethyst; March, jasper;
April, sapphire; May, chalcedony; June, emerald; July, onyx; August, carnelian; September, chrysolite;
October, aquamarine; November, topaz; December, ruby.</p>

<center>KRUGER'S UNLUCKY DIAMOND.</center>

<p>When Kruger went to Europe he took with
him a famous diamond, which was said to have brought misfortune and death to all
its possessors. It had a strange history.</p>

<p>The diamond originally belonged to Meshhesh,
a Basuto chief, from whom it was extorted by
T'Chaka, the Zulu King. T'Chaka's brother
killed him and stole the stone. The brother
came to grief and the gem passed into the
possession of a Zulu chief, who soon afterward
was assassinated. The natives say that no less
than sixteen of the successive possessors of the
diamond were either killed or driven out of
the country for the sake of the gem.</p>

<p>The diamond was then seen by white men
who sought to possess it. A party of whites attacked the natives who had the stone in their
possession, and a fierce fight ensued, in which
300 lives, mostly natives, were lost.</p>

<p>Memela, a native chief, took the gem and
concealed it in a wound which he had received
in the battle. Afterward Memela was caught
by the Boers and set to work as a slave.
Kruger, hearing his story, released him, and
in gratitude Memela gave the stone to his liberator. Some years passed, and then Kruger met
his misfortune.</p>

<p>Where the fatal diamond is now is not certain, though it is certain that the ex-President of
the Transvaal parted with it. Some say that it
is in the coffers of the Vatican, and some that
it was sold to the Emperor of Austria, and is
now among the crown jewels of Vienna.</p>

<p>The stone is said to be 200 carats in weight,
but is not perfect.--<i>Baltimore Sun</i>.</p>

<center>STRANGE WILLS.</center>

<p>There have not been many will makers more
eccentric than Mr. MacCraig, the Scotch banker,
whose last testament will shortly come under
the consideration of the Edinburgh Court of
Session. Mr. MacCraig it may be remembered left instructions in his will that
gigantic statues of himself, his brothers and sisters, a round
dozen in all, should be placed on the summit of
a great tower he had commenced to build on
Battery Hill, near Oban--each statue to cost
not less than $5,000.</p>

<p>A much more whimsical testator was a Mr.
Sanborn, of Boston, who left $5,000 to Prof.
Agassi, to have his skin converted into drum-heads and two of his bones into drumsticks, and
the balance of his fortune to his friend, Mr.
Simpson, on condition that on every 17th of
June he should repair to the foot of Bunker
Hill, and, as the sun rose, "beat on the drum
the spirit stirring strain of Yankee Doodle."</p>

birth of the second child, and so on by arithmetical progression until the
$150,000 was exhausted.</p>

minstrel, that, being examined as a witness, he was severely interrogated by the
attorney, who wished to break down his
evidence. "You are in the negro minstrel
business, I believe?" inquired the lawyer.
"Yes, sir," was the prompt reply. "Isn't that
rather a low calling?" demanded the lawyer.
"I don't know but what it is, sir," replied the
minstrel, "but it is so much better than my
father's that I am rather proud of it." "What
was your father's calling?" &quot;He was a lawyer," replied Clark, in a tone of regret that put
the audience in a roar. The lawyer let him

a poorly written sentence, "Alone and isolated, man would become impotent and perish,"
were set up as "impatient and peevish."</p>

<center>A MYSTERIOUS TELEGRAM.</center>

<p>A certain church society in Vermont resolved
on a Christmas festival, and determined to
have a scripture motto, handsomely illuminated,
in a space back of the pulpit. One of the deacons, who had business in Boston, took with
him the proposed motto and the measure of
the space to be occupied by it, but unfortunately lost the memorandum. He therefore
sent this telegram to his wife in Vermont.
"Send motto and space.&quot; She promptly complied, but the Boston telegraph girl fell off her
chair in a faint when she read off the message,
"Unto us a child is born four feet wide and
eight feet long." The deacon, however, thought
it nothing uncommon.</p>

<center>THE FOUR LEAVED SHAMROCK.</center>

<blockquote><p>"I'll seek the four leaved shamrock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all its fairy dells,<br>
And if I find its charmed leaves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh how I'll weave my spells.<br>
I would not waste my magic might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On diamonds, pearls or gold,<br>
Such treasures tire the weary heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their triumphs are but cold.</p>

<p>But I would play the enchanter's part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In casting bliss around,<br>
And not a tear or aching heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should in the world be found."</p>

<center>* * * * *</center>

<p>"To wealth I would give honor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd dry the mourner's tears,<br>
And to the pallid cheeks restore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bloom of happier years;<br>
And friends that had been long estranged,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hearts that had grown cold,<br>
Should meet again like parted streams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mingle as of old.</p>

<p>And thus I'd play the enchanter's part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In casting bliss around,<br>
And not a tear or aching heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should in the world be found.&quot;</p></blockquote>
